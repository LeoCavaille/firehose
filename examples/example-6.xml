       Example of a failure-to-analyze in which we have an error message
       and a location, but other failure fields (stdout, returncode)
       wouldn't make sense and so are omitted.

       The error message is a warning from cpychecker that the results
       are only a partial analysis; it's not achieving full coverage.

       (this was added to cpychecker in:
